# ðŸ”¤ Letter-Recognition
Working on Letter Recognition dataset, We have to classify the Letters to which type a particular belongs. Analysis two sorts of architecture; one is the artificial neural network and the other is machine learning algorithms Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier. Classification algorithms are used due to the categorical label, for classification.
Letter Recognition depends on many things taken from observations such as dimensional boxes, height, width etc. Analysis went in such a manner that it involves the comparison of modelsâ€™ accuracy among artificial neural networks, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier. Data Visualization, normalization, data cleaning and pre-processing etc. are also performed to increase the accuracy of models. Research, successfully, implemented both neural network architectures at once with optimized models. It is also elaborating the importance of algorithms, used, for optimization.
#### About Dataset

Dataset contains the 26 English alphabets as classes, so it's a multiclass classification problem with 26 classes.
Each row in the data set represents an image of a handwritten alphabet, as shown in figure 1(A). Using some basic image processing, the images are converted into m X n pixels (figure 1(B)), where m and n depend on the size and resolution of the original image. Each pixel contains numeric values, with higher values denoting the presence of dense 'ink'. In the pixels where nothing is written, the pixel value is 0.
A pixel is called 'on' if it contains to a positive numeric value, else it is called 'off'.
Using the pixelated images, 16 features are derived for each image, such as the width of the box, the ratio of the mean variance of x divided by the width of the box, etc.
